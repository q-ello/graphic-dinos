A game created for my school project, written on C++ with SFML.

Game can be played completely on keyboard or completely mouse input.

Gameplay:
This is about dinos' fight. There is three types of Dinos: strong, intellectual and dexterious.
When you go fight with your party, you end up on one of the terrain: plain, mountains or river. Different terrain buffs different types of dinos.
If you win, you get money. If you lose, you lose money too. You can also concede (and still lose some part of your money).
For money, you can buy new dinos.
If you've run out of either dinos or money, you can have one lucky dino.

Cannot say much about BGs though, I just took them from Google.
